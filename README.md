# Deal Hunter AI

Production-grade AI platform that discovers, evaluates and prioritizes
second-hand technology deals (Windows laptops, MacBooks, iPhones, game
consoles) — explainable Deal Score, repair economics, and push
notifications for saved searches.

Specification source: `Band 1/` … `Band 20/` (see [Band 1](Band%201/Band_01_Master_PRD.md)
for the master PRD). Each `Band N/` folder is the original spec input and is
kept as-is for traceability; this repo implements it incrementally.

## Repository layout

```
backend/    FastAPI backend, Clean Architecture (Python 3.13)
mobile/     Flutter app (Android/iOS)
infra/      Docker Compose, deployment config
.github/    CI workflows
Band 1..20/ Original specification documents (do not edit — reference only)
```

## Backend architecture

Modular monolith, one folder per bounded context under `backend/app/modules/`:
`auth`, `users`, `offers`, `search`, `scoring` (DealBrain), `repair`
(RepairBrain), `notifications`, `analytics`. Each module is layered:

```
modules/<name>/
  domain/          entities — no framework/DB dependency
  application/      use cases + the module's public interface (Protocol)
  infrastructure/    SQLAlchemy repos, external providers, adapters
  presentation/       FastAPI routers + Pydantic DTOs
```

Other modules and the API layer may only depend on `application/interfaces.py`
of a module — never reach into its `infrastructure/`.

## Local development

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Or via Docker Compose (Postgres + Redis + backend):

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Health check: `GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`
API docs: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`

## Tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest -m "not integration"   # unit tests only, no services required
pytest                        # full suite — needs Postgres running (see docker-compose above)
```

## Database

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head        # apply migrations
python -m scripts.seed      # seed the 4 primary device categories
```

## Marketplace Engine

`backend/app/modules/offers/` implements the Band 07 pipeline (Source →
Provider → Fetch → Normalize → Validate → Deduplicate → Persist), with two
providers:

- **`EbayApiProvider`** — eBay.com/eBay.de's official Browse API (OAuth2
  client-credentials). Needs `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`/`EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
  (a registered eBay developer application) — without them it raises a
  clear error rather than silently returning nothing.
- **`KleinanzeigenProvider`** — see the ToS note below. CSS selectors were
  confirmed against the live site on 2026-08-05; re-verify before relying
  on them, markup changes are expected over time.

Both implement the same `MarketplaceProviderProtocol`, so `IngestionService`
and `AsyncIntervalScheduler` (the scheduler foundation) work identically
regardless of source.

## DealBrain (scoring)

`backend/app/modules/scoring/` implements the Band 05 architecture:
`PriceAnalyzer`, `SpecificationAnalyzer`, `SellerAnalyzer`, `RiskAnalyzer`,
`RepairFeasibilityAnalyzer` (domain/analyzers.py, each pure and independently
testable) → `ScoringEngine` combines their `AnalyzerOutput`s into a
0-100 score → `ExplanationGenerator` derives the recommendation label and
orders factors by impact. `GET /api/v1/offers/{id}/deal-score` computes,
persists (append-only, versioned via `scoring_version`) and returns a score.

**The v1 scoring weights are a documented starting point, not a spec-mandated
formula** — Band 05 defines principles (explainable, deterministic, unknown
values reduce confidence not correctness, no hidden rules) but not concrete
numbers. Market value is estimated from the median price of comparable
active listings in the same category (DealBrain has no external pricing
data source); confidence drops sharply below 3 comparables. Expect to tune
the constants in `domain/analyzers.py` once real usage data exists.

## Status

See the 20 project tasks tracked for this build for current progress
(foundation → domain modules → API → mobile app → cross-cutting concerns).
Known gaps carried over from the specification, tracked openly rather than
papered over with placeholders:

- **eBay Kleinanzeigen** has no official public API and its Terms of Service
  prohibit automated data collection. The provider built here respects
  `robots.txt` and rate limits and does **not** bypass bot detection or
  CAPTCHAs. Get legal sign-off before enabling it in production
  (`KLEINANZEIGEN_PROVIDER_ENABLED` defaults to `false`).
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** (notifications) requires a real Firebase
  project + service account credentials, supplied by the project owner.
- **eBay developer credentials** are needed for `EbayApiProvider` to hit
  real endpoints — until then it's fully tested against mocked HTTP
  responses (`tests/unit/test_ebay_api_provider.py`) but unverified against
  the live API.
- Bands 11–15 and 17–20 were delivered as section skeletons rather than
  filled specifications; implementation follows established industry
  practice for those areas rather than a documented Deal Hunter AI–specific
  requirement.
